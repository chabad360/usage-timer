# Usage Timer

A computer shutdown timer written in Go using [Gotk3](github.com/gotk3/gotk3).

> Warning: This project is my first written in Go (and GTK). I can pretty much guaranty that there will be stuff here that will make you face palm (or perhaps to things much worse that that).

> So: Here be baby dragons.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `go build`
3. Run `./timer`
4. Enjoy

> Warning: If you don't find a way to kill this thing before the timer expires, your system **will shutdown**.
